# AttractorGenerator
This is a personal project.
I am constructing a primitive rendering engine for Windows desktops that will allow the user to render various polygonal shapes in 3D space as a way to simultaneously practice C++ and vector math.
The final goal is to render the lorenz attractor with a light source illuminating it, and to translate that render into a PNG image.
#### The project is not near completion, but it's just getting to the good part.
